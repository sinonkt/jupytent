JupyterLab - An extensible computational environment for Jupyter.

This launches a Tornado based HTML Server that serves up an HTML5/Javascript
JupyterLab client.

JupyterLab has three different modes of running:

* Core mode (`--core-mode`): in this mode JupyterLab will run using the JavaScript
  assets contained in the installed `jupyterlab` Python package. In core mode, no
  extensions are enabled. This is the default in a stable JupyterLab release if you
  have no extensions installed.
* Dev mode (`--dev-mode`): uses the unpublished local JavaScript packages in the
  `dev_mode` folder.  In this case JupyterLab will show a red stripe at the top of
  the page.  It can only be used if JupyterLab is installed as `pip install -e .`.
* App mode: JupyterLab allows multiple JupyterLab "applications" to be
  created by the user with different combinations of extensions. The `--app-dir` can
  be used to set a directory for different applications. The default application
  path can be found using `jupyter lab path`.

Subcommands
===========
Subcommands are launched as `jupyter-notebook cmd [args]`. For information on
using subcommand 'cmd', do: `jupyter-notebook cmd -h`.

Options
=======
The options below are convenience aliases to configurable class-options,
as listed in the "Equivalent to" description-line of the aliases.
To see all configurable class-options for some <cmd>, use:
    <cmd> --help-all

--debug
    set log level to logging.DEBUG (maximize logging output)
    Equivalent to: [--Application.log_level=10]
--generate-config
    generate default config file
    Equivalent to: [--JupyterApp.generate_config=True]
-y
    Answer yes to any questions instead of prompting.
    Equivalent to: [--JupyterApp.answer_yes=True]
--no-browser
    Don't open the notebook in a browser after startup.
    Equivalent to: [--NotebookApp.open_browser=False]
--pylab
    DISABLED: use %pylab or %matplotlib in the notebook to enable matplotlib.
    Equivalent to: [--NotebookApp.pylab=warn]
--no-mathjax
    Disable MathJax
    
    MathJax is the javascript library Jupyter uses to render math/LaTeX. It is
    very large, so you may want to disable it if you have a slow internet
    connection, or for offline use of the notebook.
    
    When disabled, equations etc. will appear as their untransformed TeX source.
    Equivalent to: [--NotebookApp.enable_mathjax=False]
--allow-root
    Allow the notebook to be run from root user.
    Equivalent to: [--NotebookApp.allow_root=True]
--autoreload
    Autoreload the webapp
    
    Enable reloading of the tornado webapp and all imported Python packages
    when any changes are made to any Python src files in Notebook or
    extensions.
    Equivalent to: [--NotebookApp.autoreload=True]
--script
    DEPRECATED, IGNORED
    Equivalent to: [--FileContentsManager.save_script=True]
--no-script
    DEPRECATED, IGNORED
    Equivalent to: [--FileContentsManager.save_script=False]
--core-mode
    Start the app in core mode.
    Equivalent to: [--LabApp.core_mode=True]
--dev-mode
    Start the app in dev mode for running from source.
    Equivalent to: [--LabApp.dev_mode=True]
--watch
    Start the app in watch mode.
    Equivalent to: [--LabApp.watch=True]
--expose-app-in-browser
    Expose the global app instance to browser via window.jupyterlab
    Equivalent to: [--LabApp.expose_app_in_browser=True]
--log-level=<Enum>
    Set the log level by value or name.
    Choices: any of [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 'DEBUG', 'INFO', 'WARN', 'ERROR', 'CRITICAL']
    Default: 30
    Equivalent to: [--Application.log_level]
--config=<Unicode>
    Full path of a config file.
    Default: ''
    Equivalent to: [--JupyterApp.config_file]
--ip=<Unicode>
    The IP address the notebook server will listen on.
    Default: 'localhost'
    Equivalent to: [--NotebookApp.ip]
--port=<Int>
    The port the notebook server will listen on (env: JUPYTER_PORT).
    Default: 8888
    Equivalent to: [--NotebookApp.port]
--port-retries=<Int>
    The number of additional ports to try if the specified port is not available
    (env: JUPYTER_PORT_RETRIES).
    Default: 50
    Equivalent to: [--NotebookApp.port_retries]
--sock=<Unicode>
    The UNIX socket the notebook server will listen on.
    Default: ''
    Equivalent to: [--NotebookApp.sock]
--sock-mode=<Unicode>
    The permissions mode for UNIX socket creation (default: 0600).
    Default: '0600'

    Default: ''
    Equivalent to: [--NotebookApp.keyfile]
--certfile=<Unicode>
    The full path to an SSL/TLS certificate file.
    Default: ''

--browser=<Unicode>
    Specify what command to use to invoke a web browser when opening the
